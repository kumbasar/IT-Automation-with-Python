Feedback: {'title': 'Best experience so far', 'date': '2019-12-09', 'feedback': "My friend recommended this place and  I decided to give a try. I called them beforehand and made sure they have the models I was looking for. They evenly sent me a bunch of photos and specs of the car I was looking for. One the day I visited, the sales person John helped me with test drive and showed me what I should be aware of when buying a used car. I felt like I learned a lot. They made the process so smooth that I saved a lot of time. It's the best car purchasing experience I had so far!", 'name': 'Katie'}

Feedback: {'title': 'Waste of my time', 'date': '2018-09-21', 'feedback': "I came in around 6pm and they seemed about to close the store. One of the sales seemed not being patient with me and made me feel like I have to either buy a car or come back later. Of course I didn't buy a car there. Hopefully they can treat every customer with more patience.", 'name': 'Anonymous'}
